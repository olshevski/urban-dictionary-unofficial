# Urban Dictionary Unofficial

Unofficial Android client for [urbandictionary.com](https://urbandictionary.com) website. Written during the summer of 2020 as a hobby project and a study of a new Kotlin's [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html) API and Jetpack's [Paging 3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-migration) library.

The app was published to Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.olshevski.udu) and never maintained/updated ever since.
